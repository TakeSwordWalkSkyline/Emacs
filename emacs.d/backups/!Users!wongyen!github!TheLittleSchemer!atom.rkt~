;; #The Five Rules

;; # The Low of Car
;; #    The primitive car is defined only for non-empty lists.


;; # The Low of Cdr
;; #    The primitive adr is defined only for non-empty lists.
;; #    The cdr of any non-empty list is always another list.


;; # The Low of Cons
;; #    The primitive Cons takes two arguments
;; #    The second argument to Cons must be a list
;; #    The result is a list


;; # The Low of Null?
;; #    The primitive null? is defined only for list


;; # The Low of Eq?
;; #    The primitive eq? takes two arguments
;; #    Each must be a non-numeric atom.
